	<content><![CDATA[Reading some <a href="http://news.lilynet.net/spip.php?page=forum&id_article=130">Lilypond related news</a>, I've just stumbled on this:

<p><i>"Finally, I have to announce (proudly) that the record for the Silliest Software Name, Ever, is currently held by a French music program whose name roughly translates as... "crepe batter". Think about that, next time someone tells you "LilyPond" is a stupid name."</i></p>

<p>I'm still laughing for the award of Silliest Software Name, Ever ^^ I guess I deserve it :)</p>

<p>For those that did not dare asking, I came with the name "patacrep" for my personal website since "crep" is my nickname (I used to eat a *lot* of those crêpes). Thus, "patacrep" (from "pâte à crêpes") represents fairly well the mix of my projects and softwares (with much more traditional names such as songbook and songbook-client :p).</p>

<p>But seriously, I'm really proud of this award!</p>]]></content>
